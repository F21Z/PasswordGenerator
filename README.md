# PasswordGenerator

Date: 22nd May 2023<br>
Author: Mohammed Faizuddin<br>
Project: Password Generator<br>
For: Learning Arrays, Pointers, Functions<br>
Language: C<br>

Description:<br>
This C program generates a password using the rand() function. The generated password will be random in nature, it will have at least one capital letter, one small letter, one number and one special character("!@#$%^&*()~<>,.?;:{}[]=+-_|"). The initial program is set to generate a password of length 8 but I will modify it later to make it user selectable. 

I have completed the Arrays and Pointers chapters and am currently in the Functions chapter. The objective of this project is to put to practice what I have learned. I will be uploading multiple versions while doing the project and after each improvement in the program. 

Please feel free to review my code and share your feedback and improvement suggestions.
